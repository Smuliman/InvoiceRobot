# RPA Project

This is a study project where the task was to create a automation process using either Robot Framework or Microsoft Power Automate.
I chose Robot Framework and I got the idea for the process from my work. So this robot opens invoice from browser, downloads it as a pdf, checks if it matches the expected amount and then proceeds depending the outcome of the check. If the invoice doesn't match with expected amount, robot asks human to do a closer check.

To achieve this I utilized Robocorps tools:

# Template: Standard Robot Framework

This is the simplest template to start from.

- Get started from a simple task template in `tasks.robot`.
  - Uses [Robot Framework](https://robocorp.com/docs/languages-and-frameworks/robot-framework/basics) syntax.
- You can configure your robot `robot.yaml`.
- You can configure dependencies in `conda.yaml`.
